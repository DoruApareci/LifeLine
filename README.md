## Description
This is a straightforward blood bank management system, allowing individuals to search and register as blood donors. Additionally, users can track the number of people in need of blood and the number of lives saved through blood donations. The system also features a statistics page displaying various blood bank statistics.

P.S. This project is part of my university internship at the software company Alvys COM SRL.
